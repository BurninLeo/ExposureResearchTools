Exposure Research Tools (Piwik Plugin)

This plugin restructures data collected via Piwik to be used in Selective Exposure research.
When retrieving the data, the tool extracts an identification variable from the first visit's GET request (action) to allow merging survey data with observational data from Piwik.

The tools adds a menu item "Research Tools" -> "Export Visits" to the Piwik menu.

For a detailed discussion of the tool and its application in selective exposure research, please refer to our paper.
